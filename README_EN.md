## ✨ Project Origin
Have you ever been stuck in this situation: you have a report due tomorrow, but your PPT is still a blank canvas; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, but all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design work?

I (we) long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the "speed" requirement, they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only allow selection of preset templates, lacking flexibility in style adjustment.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ The final results look similar, leading to heavy homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low material quality and lack of specificity.
- 5️⃣ Split between text and graphics layout, resulting in poor design sense.

These flaws make traditional AI PPT generators fail to satisfy our dual needs for both "speed" and "beauty." Even if they claim to be "Vibe PPT," in my eyes, they are far from being "Vibe" enough.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can almost accurately render all the text required by the prompt and follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Target Audience

1. **Novices**: Generate beautiful PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Get quick design inspiration by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of graphics and text.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plans to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Rapidly complete presentation assignments, focusing energy on content rather than layout and beautification.
5. **Business Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, adapting to multiple scenarios rapidly.

## 📦 Usage

### Using Docker Compose🐳 (Recommended)
This is the simplest deployment method, starting both frontend and backend services with one click.

<details>
  <summary>📒 Instructions for Windows Users</summary>

If you are using Windows, please install Windows Docker Desktop first. Check the Docker icon in the system tray to ensure Docker is running, then follow the same steps.

> **Tip**: If you encounter issues, ensure WSL 2 backend is enabled in Docker Desktop settings (recommended), and make sure ports 3000 and 5000 are not occupied.

</details>

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file (refer to `.env.example`):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to configure necessary environment variables:
> **The LLM interface in this project follows the AIHubMix platform format standards. It is recommended to use [AIHubMix](https://aihubmix.com/?aff=17EC) to obtain API keys to minimize migration costs.**  
```env
# AI Provider Format (gemini / openai / vertex)
AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=gemini

# Gemini configuration (used when AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=gemini)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
GOOGLE_API_BASE=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com
# Proxy example: https://aihubmix.com/gemini

# OpenAI configuration (used when AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=openai)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
# Proxy example: https://aihubmix.com/v1

# Vertex AI configuration (used when AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex)
# Requires GCP service account, can use GCP free tier
# VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
# VERTEX_LOCATION=global
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./gcp-service-account.json
...
```

**To use the new version of the editable export configuration and obtain better results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu Intelligent Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) and fill it in the `BAIDU_OCR_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (ample free tier is available). See the explanation at https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Using Vertex AI (GCP Free Tier)</summary>

If you want to use Google Cloud Vertex AI (GCP new user credits can be used), additional configuration is required:

1. Create a service account in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and download the JSON key file.
2. Rename the key file to `gcp-service-account.json` and place it in the project root directory.
3. Edit the `.env` file:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment the following:
   ```yaml
   # environment:
   #   - GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/gcp-service-account.json
   # ...
   # - ./gcp-service-account.json:/app/gcp-service-account.json:ro
   ```

> **Note**: `gemini-3-*` series models require setting `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start the services**

**⚡ Use pre-built images**

The project provides built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch). You can skip the local build step for rapid deployment:

```bash
# Start using pre-built images (no need to build from scratch)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configuration in the `.env` file and rerun the start command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources (for China users)
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com

**FAQ**
1.  **Does it support the free tier Gemini API Key?**
    *   The free tier only supports text generation, not image generation.
2.  **503 Error or Retry Error during generation**
    *   You can check the Docker internal logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.
3.  **Why does the API Key in .env not take effect?**
    1.  Editing `.env` at runtime requires restarting the Docker container to apply changes.
    2.  If you set it in the web settings page, it will override the `.env` parameters. You can restore to `.env` settings via "Restore Default Settings."
4.  **Garbled text in generated pages**
    *   Try higher resolution output (OpenAI format might not support this).
    *   Ensure the page description contains the specific text content to be rendered.
